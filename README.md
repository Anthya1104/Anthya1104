## AboutðŸ‘‹
<hr>

Hi, I'm Yusa.
I'm currently in a gap year for self-study in web development, basically focused on frontend skills but with some little treats about backend knowledgs.
I have **4 years of experience** in games industries. I worked as an artist in usual case, but I could also support the programming tasks in need. Beside the development part, I have once worked in partnership with **Blizzard Entertainment** for marketing and strategies, and successfully reached more than **400,000** social engagements in the launch day when **DIABLO II: resurrected** released.
