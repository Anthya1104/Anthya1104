## AboutðŸ‘‹
<hr>


Hi, I'm Yusa.
I'm currently in self-study about web development, basically focused on frontend React.js and Node.js.
I have **4 years of experience** in game's industries. Mostly I worked as an artist generalist, and I could also support for programming tasks in need. 
Beside development, I have worked in partnership with **Blizzard Entertainment** for marketing and strategies, and successfully reached more than **400,000** community engagements in the launch day when **Diablo II: Resurrected** released.

:sparkles: **Currently in job hunting**<br>

:sparkles: **Feel free to get in touch**<br>
